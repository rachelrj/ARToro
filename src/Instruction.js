                            <p>I am a certified art teacher in Kindergarten through 12th grade. I earned my masters degree in Art Education at Florida State University in 2016. My teaching career spans over five years in which I have taught elementary, middle and high school. In 2020 I began privately tutoring adults and children.  While my focus is primarily painting, I tutor in any visual arts form of your choice including drawing,painting, ceramics, etc.</p>

Private art tutoring also can improve a portfolio for an art school application. Private art tutoring can also be a way to create a sentimental and personalized gift for a loved one.  I  will work with you to address your specific needs and create an individualized plan to pursue you or your childâ€™s goals as an artist. </p>
