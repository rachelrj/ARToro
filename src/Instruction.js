                I am a certified Pre-K-12th grade art teacher in the state of
                Montana and Colorado. I earned my Masters degree in Art
                Education at Florida State University in 2016. My teaching
                career spans over seven years in which I have taught elementary,
                middle, and high school. In 2020 I began privately tutoring
                adults and children. While my focus is primarily painting, I
                tutor in any visual arts form of your choice including drawing,
                oil, acrylic, and watercolor painting, as well as basic book
                binding.

              There are many advantages to private art tutoring. Art making has
              therapeutic benefits and promotes mental health and well being.
              Private art tutoring also can improve a portfolio for an art
              school application. Private art tutoring can also be a way to
              create a sentimental and personalized gift for a loved one. I will
              work with you to address your specific needs and create an
              individualized plan to pursue you or your childâ€™s goals as an
              artist.{" "}
